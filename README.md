# ADI Kuiper Linux

Kuiper is a specialized Debian-based Linux distribution designed specifically for Analog Devices hardware and evaluation boards. It provides a complete, ready-to-use environment with ADI libraries, tools, and applications pre-configured for seamless hardware integration.

Whether you're prototyping with an ADI evaluation board, developing embedded applications, or building software-defined radio solutions, Kuiper gives you a solid foundation to start immediately without the complexity of manual system configuration.
