ADI Kuiper Linux
================

Kuiper is a specialized Debian-based Linux distribution designed specifically 
for Analog Devices hardware and evaluation boards. It provides a complete, 
ready-to-use environment with ADI libraries, tools, and applications 
pre-configured for seamless hardware integration.

Whether you're prototyping with an ADI evaluation board, developing embedded 
applications, or building software-defined radio solutions, Kuiper gives you 
a solid foundation to start immediately without the complexity of manual 
system configuration.

   ADI Kuiper Linux - A specialized Debian distribution for Analog Devices 
   hardware with pre-configured libraries, tools, and applications for 
   seamless development

----

Quick Start
-----------

Get up and running with Kuiper on Raspberry Pi:

#. :doc:`Check prerequisites <prerequisites>` (Ubuntu 22.04 + Docker for building)
#. Get Kuiper image:

   - **Quick option**: Download pre-built from :git-adi-kuiper-gen:`GitHub Actions <actions/workflows/kuiper2_0-build.yml+>`
   - **Custom option**: Clone repository and build your own

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/adi-kuiper-gen
      cd adi-kuiper-gen
      sudo ./build-docker.sh

For detailed instructions, see the :doc:`Quick Start <quick-start>` section.

#. :doc:`Write the image to an SD card and boot your device <use-kuiper-image>`

**For ADI evaluation boards**: See :doc:`Hardware Configuration <hardware-configuration>` 
for setup instructions.
