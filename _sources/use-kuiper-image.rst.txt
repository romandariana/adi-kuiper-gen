Using Kuiper Images
===================

After obtaining your Kuiper image (built or downloaded), you'll need to write 
it to an SD card or storage device and boot your target hardware. This section 
guides you through that process.

----

Extracting the Image
--------------------

The build process produces a zip file in the ``kuiper-volume/`` directory. 
Extract it using:

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Extract the image

   # Navigate to the kuiper-volume directory
   cd kuiper-volume

   # Extract the image
   unzip image_YYYY-MM-DD-ADI-Kuiper-Linux-[arch].zip

----

Writing the Image to an SD Card
-------------------------------

Using Balena Etcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Balena Etcher <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`_ provides a simple, graphical 
interface for writing images to SD cards and is the recommended method:

1. **Download and install** `Balena Etcher <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`_.
2. **Launch Etcher** and click "Flash from file".
3. **Select the image file** you extracted from the zip.
4. **Select your SD card** as the target.
5. **Click "Flash"** and wait for the process to complete.

Using Command Line on Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For users who prefer command line tools:

1. **Insert your SD card** into your computer.
2. **Identify the device name** of your SD card:

   .. code-block:: bash

      lsblk

   Look for a device like ``/dev/sdX`` or ``/dev/mmcblkX`` (where X is a 
   letter or number) that matches your SD card's size.

3. **Unmount any auto-mounted partitions**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo umount /dev/sdX*

   Replace ``/dev/sdX`` with your actual device path.

4. **Write the image to the SD card**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo dd if=image_YYYY-MM-DD-ADI-Kuiper-Linux-[arch].img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync

   Replace ``/dev/sdX`` with your actual device path, and update the image 
   filename accordingly.

5. **Eject the SD card**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo eject /dev/sdX

Alternative Image Writing Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While Balena Etcher is recommended for its simplicity and cross-platform 
support, you can also use these alternatives:

**Linux alternatives:**
- GNOME Disks (pre-installed on most GNOME-based distributions)
- Ubuntu Disk Image Writer
- Popsicle

**Windows alternatives:**  
- Win32 Disk Imager
- Rufus

**All platforms:**
- Raspberry Pi Imager (works with any .img file, not just Pi images)

----

Booting Your Device
-------------------

1. **Insert the SD card** into your target device.
2. **Connect required peripherals** (power, display, keyboard if needed).
3. **Power on the device**.
4. The first boot may take longer as the system automatically resizes the 
   root partition to use the full SD card capacity.

----

Login Information
-----------------

- **Username**: analog
- **Password**: analog

Root access is available using the same password with ``sudo`` or by logging 
in directly as root.

----

Accessing Your Kuiper System
----------------------------

Console Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect directly with a keyboard and display if your hardware supports it.

SSH Access
~~~~~~~~~~

If your device is connected to a network, you can access it via SSH:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh analog@<device-ip-address>

Replace ``<device-ip-address>`` with the actual IP address of your device.

VNC Access (If desktop environment was enabled)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you built your image with ``CONFIG_DESKTOP=y``, you can access the 
graphical environment via VNC:

1. Connect to your device using a VNC client (like RealVNC, TigerVNC, or 
   Remmina).
2. Use the device's IP address and port 5900 (e.g., ``192.168.1.100:5900``).

----

Verifying Your Installation
---------------------------

To verify that your Kuiper image is working correctly:

1. **Check system information**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cat /etc/os-release
      uname -a

2. **Verify ADI tools** (if you included them in your build):

   .. code-block:: bash

      # For libiio (if installed)
      iio_info -h

      # For IIO Oscilloscope (if installed)
      osc -h

3. **Check available hardware**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # List connected IIO devices (if libiio installed)
      iio_info

For ADI evaluation boards: If you need to configure your Kuiper system for 
a specific ADI evaluation board and carrier combination, see 
:doc:`Hardware Configuration <hardware-configuration>` for the complete 
setup process.
